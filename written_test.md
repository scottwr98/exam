## Written Portion (40 min)
This part of the test is closed book!

1. You've started a project in JavaScript, but for some reason your runtime lacks the `map` function! Attach one to the `Array` prototype!

```js

/* As a reminder, `map` takes a callback function and returns a *new* array, with each new value created by the output of the callback function. So:

const arr = [1,2,3];
arr.map((val) => val * val) // [1,4,9]

*/

```

Please write your answer [here](./map.js)

5. Reverse an array. Write a function that accepts an array and returns *the same array* with the values reversed.

```js
const arr = [1,2,3];
reverseArr(arr);
console.log(arr) // [3,2,1];
```

Please write your answer [here](./reverseArr.js)
